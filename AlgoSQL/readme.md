
# SQL Algo Project

We created a backtest in our Project. This backtest created a dataframe, which we then created a CSV for. We will import the csv and use SQL commands in SQLite to Query the data. Follow the project in our jupyter notebook.

## Objective

My objective was to run SQL Queries on data in order to analyze the results of the algorithmic backtest. 

We can then discover if the backtest strategy was profitable enough to continue developing and perhaps deploy.  


## Challenges

A challenge I had was deciding what visualization would help display standard deviation and averages in the simplest form.  

## Solutions 

I found that a seaborn boxplot could help me visualize the daily returns in the simplest format. 


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run deploy
```
