    "        <p>The corporation, SQL Bank, wishes to attract investors for an IPO but first need to clean and fix their accounting, sales and credit systems.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Recently, their internal systems have flagged 100 transactions for suspicious activity along with transacting while not paying on time, and also a few accounts somehow transacting while in suspended or terminated state.</p>\n",
    "        <p>SQLBank's clients tend to be Vendors, Retail and Private-- who wholesale short term credit and issue payment systems to their own customers.</p>\n",
    "        <p>The payment systems take Cryptocurrencies, USD Cash and VendorBucks. VendorBucks are white-labeled credit cards issued by the Vendors to their customers. The Vendors then borrow money from SQL Bank in order to furnish credit and loans to their clients.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Before making decisions, the Board has requested the Data Team to come up with unique Looker Dashboards using CSV files and SQL.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Here, we create a Python script that Transforms the Flagged Transaction Data CSV into SQL, then runs queries which are visualized in Seaborn. We then use the CSV Data to make a Dashboard using Google Looker.</p>\n",
    "        <p>We can then embed the Dashboard into an HTML file with pertinent project data and analysis. This HTML site is then downloaded and stored in an Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket for storage.</p>\n",

    "              <p><strong>i.</strong> We can see that Florida had the highest number overall of transactions while USD CASH had the highest average transaction amount per currency group.</p>\n",
    "        <p>SQLBank can now look into how to make sure the Florida flagged transactions can be reduced. Next steps can include running a Florida specific report on account status, late payments, and root causes for flagged transactions in the region.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>ii.</strong> The average transaction amount that was flagged was around $3,000 dollars.</p>\n",
    "        <p>SQLBank can now investigate further as to why this amount is the most common amongst flagged accounts. Next month a SQL Query can be run as to focus on transactions in this bandwidth.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>iii.</strong> Transfers had the highest amounts per transaction but Withdrawals were the most frequent.</p>\n",
    "        <p>This is problematic as flagged withdrawals offer the least chance of recouping losses or fraudulent charges and transactions. We can now check our data and dashboard and see which regions had the highest withdrawals.</p>\n",
    "        <p><strong>iv.</strong> The Dashboard reveals that the least problematic region for SQLBank is the West Coast.</p>\n",
    "        <p>A manager from the Fraud team will be sent out to the California Branches along with the SouthWestern regions to investigate how things are run better there and why there are less flagged transactions. By contrasting business practices in the West Coast to the more problematic Eastern seaboard clients, SQLBank looks to bridge the gap within their flagged transactions and fraud departments.</p>\n",

    "        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "        <p>In conclusion, our analysis of the banking and money movement data reveals some interesting insights. Florida emerged as the state with the highest number of transactions overall, indicating a significant volume of financial activity in the region. Additionally, USD CASH stood out with the highest average transaction amount per currency group, suggesting that transactions involving this currency tend to be larger on average.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Furthermore, the dominance of Withdrawal as the most popular transaction type highlights a common financial behavior among account holders. This finding underscores the importance of understanding customer preferences and behaviors to tailor financial services effectively.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Overall, this project demonstrates the value of data analysis in uncovering patterns and trends within financial datasets, providing valuable insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making processes.</p>\n",
