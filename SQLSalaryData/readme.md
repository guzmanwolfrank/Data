## SQL: Salary Data

![avgsal](https://github.com/guzmanwolfrank/SQL/assets/29739578/b161b907-2b5c-46a6-b4e3-21ab12414a54)

## Project Description

In this SQL project we combine Python and SQL while generating fictional data using the Faker module. We will generate information for a fictional survey which details salaries, survey questions, age and other data to then analyze and look for patterns in the data.


        Software: SQL, Python 3.11, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
        Languages: SQL, Python
        Modules: Faker, Seaborn, Pandas, SQLite3, Matplotlib

## Goals 
To practice using SQL Queries to solve problems and analyze randomly generated data.  Another goal was to simply use the Faker module and see how flexible it is generating data for 
visualization purposes.  Generating Fake data is also useful in algorithmic research when running algorithms multiple times to find patterns in random sequences. 

## Initial Queries for SQLite 

High Earners: Identify and analyze individuals earning above $200,000.

Top Earner: Determine the individual with the highest salary and their occupation.

Youngest Worker: Identify the youngest individual in the dataset and their details.

Occupation Salaries: Calculate and analyze average salaries for each occupation.

Top 10 Paying Occupations: Rank and analyze the top 10 highest-paying occupations.

Education Level vs. Salary: Analyze the relationship between education level and average salary.

Job Satisfaction by State: Calculate and analyze average job satisfaction scores for each state.

## Project Planning / Process 

Acquire: Acquire the data by using Faker Module and generating the data in Python within a Pandas Dataframe.  <br/> 
Prepare:  Prepare the data by cleaning, filtering n/a values, and sorting the data. 
Explore:  I plan to use Seaborn and SQLite Python module to explore and visualize the information.  I am using SQL Queries via SQLite in order to answer my initial queries. 

## Exploring the Data 

Let's explore the data generated by the module by listing the top ten highest paying occupations.

*Note:  Here we see the consequence of using a fake data generator module such as Faker but will reap the benefit in having random data, visualized.

## Findings 
I found that the average salary in this survey is $140,061.62

Accounting for the randomness of the data, we see that the Highest Earner in this itiration of the program is Tony Brown.  A 47 year old Male Speech Pathologist from Guam who currently resides and works in Oklahoma onsite.  

The highest count of age group belongs to 51 and over at 81 in the survey. 

The scatter plot on Seaborn shows us that the higher strata salaries pertain to higher education levels.  
Graduate school graduates and Doctorate holders were the most frequent high earners.  

Another finding was that Oklahoma had the highest satisfaction scores in the survey.  

## Conclusion 
An analysis of a fictional survey dataset generated using Python and SQL revealed the following key findings:

The average salary in the survey is $140,061.62
The highest earner is Tony Brown, a 47-year-old male speech pathologist from Guam who currently resides and works in Oklahoma onsite
The highest count of age group belongs to 51 and over
The scatter plot on Seaborn shows that the higher strata salaries pertain to higher education levels, with graduate school graduates and doctorate holders being the most frequent high earners
Oklahoma had the highest satisfaction scores in the survey
These findings suggest that there is a strong correlation between education level, salary, and job satisfaction. Additionally, the data suggests that Oklahoma is a desirable place to live and work.

### Recommendations

Based on these findings, the following recommendations can be made:

Individuals who are interested in maximizing their earning potential should consider pursuing higher education.
Employers should invest in training and development programs for their employees.
State and local governments should create policies that attract and retain high-skilled workers.
