In this SQL project we combine Python and SQL while generating fictional data using the Faker module.
We will generate information for a fictional survey which details salaries, survey questions, age and other data to then analyze and look for patterns in the data.


        Software: SQL, Python 3.11, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
        Languages: SQL, Python
        Modules: Seaborn, Pandas, SQLite3, Matplotlib
