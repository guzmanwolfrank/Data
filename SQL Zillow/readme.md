Here we analyze Zillow Housing Data to check for highest cost locations, market trends and other patterns. 

This SQL project takes us through Python programming, SQL data cleansing, data analysis and data presentation via dashboard.

## Findings 
We ran 7 SQL Queries using SQLite and Python to realize that home values, in Zillow's Top Tier Home Value Data have risen dramatically.

We also learned on Chart 5, a histogram, that the amount of mid range priced homes is dwindling. Homes across the Top Tier are becoming more expensive and concentrating in a handful of states.

Chart 4 also taught us some new developments, surprisingly to some, Montana has had the highest overall change in Top Tier Home Value across the United States dating back to 2019.

Overall, using SQLite, SQL Queries and Python we were able to analyze Zillow Top Tier Home Data for emerging trends and specific locations with higher values.
